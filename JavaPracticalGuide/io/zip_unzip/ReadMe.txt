==> We can Zip, Unzip files using Java Classes Easily.
==> Here it is how you can do it too!

1. Zip.java is used for zipping the file using DeflaterOutputStream

2. Unzip.java is used for unzipping the file using InflaterInputStream

 (Both De&In - flater Class are present inside java.util.zip package)

<----------------To Zip your file------------------->

1. Replace textStore file with your file (rename it to textStore if you don't want to alter code).
2. Run Zip.java using - java Zip (Compile in case you don't see Zip.class)
3. Zipped file will be formed under name outputZipped.

<-----------------To Unzip your file------------------>

1. Replace outputZipped with your zipped file (replace name to outputZipped)
2. Run Unzip.java using - java UnZip (Compile in case you don't see Unzip.class)
3. Unzipped file will be formed under name unzipped.txt

NOTE: FILE TO ZIP OR UNZIP MUST BE INDIVIDUAL FILE - MUST NOT BE FOLDER!
